## Project title
# EDU Token Staking Protocol with Dynamic Rewards

## Project Description

The **EDU Token Staking Protocol** allows users to stake their $EDU tokens in exchange for rewards. The protocol features dynamic reward rates that increase over time, providing an incentive for long-term token holders. Rewards are calculated based on the duration of the staking and the total amount staked. Additionally, a reward inflation feature allows the reward rate to grow yearly, making long-term staking more attractive.

This contract enables users to:
- Stake their $EDU tokens to earn rewards.
- Earn rewards that increase annually based on inflation.
- Claim rewards at any time.
- Unstake tokens when desired, with the rewards earned during the staking period.

## Project Vision

The primary goal of the EDU Token Staking Protocol is to foster a sustainable and long-term staking ecosystem for the $EDU token. By providing dynamic rewards that increase over time, this protocol incentivizes users to hold and stake their tokens, thus promoting token scarcity and overall ecosystem stability.

The vision is to create an engaging staking environment where users are rewarded for their loyalty and participation, fostering growth in the $EDU community while also offering a steady stream of passive income to stakers.

6. **Transparent and Trustworthy**: The contract is deployed on a public blockchain, ensuring full transparency and security for all users.






## Future Improvements

- **Governance**: Implement a governance system where stakers can vote on important protocol changes or updates.
- **Staking Pools**: Allow users to stake their tokens in different pools with varying reward rates or lock-up periods.
- **Additional Incentives**: Introduce bonus rewards or NFT-based incentives for long-term stakers.
